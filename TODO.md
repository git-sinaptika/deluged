#### Todo Docker:   
- [x] Create some instructions and a decent README  
  - [x] basic instructions done, need to expand
  - [x] remove some markdown specific features for readability on dh and plaintext
  - [ ] Create an advanced example with proxy, volume and docker network considerations
- [x] Remove pwgen generated password for deluged from build logs and images hosted on docker-hub   
  - [x] removed password generation from build phase  
  - [x] ~~docker pull still gets the pass from built image, ONBUILD is of no use in this case~~
  - [x] redo *echo user:pwgen -1 8:10 >> auth* into a script in Dockerfile, then let user docker exec?
  - [x] deluged-pass.sh done, placed in /opt/deluge/config/ and linked to /usr/bin
- [x] Find some best practices on handling secrets in docker containers?
  - [x] moved password generation to to script, only other way involves added software  
- [ ] Find a solution to file ownership without adding chown scripts with COPY/ADD?   
  - [x] Already an entrypoint.sh in testing :(
  - [x] trying to make the simplest posible su-exec chown and exec script
  - the correct way is still passing --build-arg on docker build or editing Dockerfile
  - ~~is --user and config files from outside a solution(chown scripts are looking better and better)~~
   - not worth it, easier edditing Dockerfile or entrypoint.sh
- [ ] Is usage viable on a NAS appliance?
  - [x] Synology Rackstation works perfectly, what about devices cheaper than my car?
- [x] Remove a couple more packages after build layer and start using --virtual-package in apk?
  - [x] no need for apk --virtual-package, readability is fine
  - [x] removed a couple of packages
  - [x] removed build files
- [ ] Define more volumes in Dockerfile or let it be?
  - should we define all 3? Should we also set move on complete to true, for volumes on cow fs?
  - should we create a separate volume for ssl cert?
- [ ] Is there to much metadata in the image via ENV and LABEL?
  - generating reverse proxy templates works without a problem (nginx, caddy), but is it of use to anyone else?

#### Todo Deluge
- [x] Define sane config location (/opt/deluge/config works nicely)
- [x] Set ENV in a way, that enables manual Dockerfile edditing
- [x] Test how deluged handles unexpected shutdown
  - [x] torrent.state and pid related stuff works after power off
  - [x] no need for any kind of init, since deluged is well behaved
  - [x] still tini looks really nice (and is in all recent docker versions), should implement anyway?
  - [ ] should we let user decide, since docker create --init works without a hitch?
- [x] Setting deluged configuration values:
  - [x] Using deluged-console like we are supposed to
  - [x] When starting deluged, give it some time, before setting values
  - [x] Separate commands, so even on failure of one, others values get set
  - [x] Enable debug for first run
  - [x] Shut down deluged with deluge-console not kill!!
  - Exit codes make build fails on docker-hub :( :(
- [x] Performance testing with docker network drivers
  - [x] works as expected on default (legacy bridge)
  - [x] works as expected on vlan and macvlan
  - no difference measured on container and host deluged on 1gb and 10gb
  - we were lucky and tested when ubuntu 17.04 came out
  - set insane connection numbers and it was suprisingly stable, gj libtorrent and deluge guys
  - udp works as advertised
  - dht works as advertised
- [ ] Figure out compiling just the needed modules with python setuptools
